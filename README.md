# fun_triangle_problems
Triangle problems that are solved using probabilistic techniques and elementary counting

This repository contains some elementary questions about triads of integers forming triangles and we use elementary counting techniques and ideas from applied probability to present exact and numeric solutions to a few problems.

In the scratch-work branch -- aligjned problems are proposed and solved
